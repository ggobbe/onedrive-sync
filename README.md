**This is a work in progress, it is recommended not to use this tool with your OneDrive as it might result in unexpected results.**

# onedrive-sync [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ggobbe/onedrive-sync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ggobbe/onedrive-sync)
OneDrive-Sync has the goal to provide
* a **Go library** wrapping the new [OneDrive API](http://onedrive.github.io/)
* a **CLI** tool to push or pull documents/folders from and to OneDrive
* a bidirectional **synchronisation client** allowing to keep a folder in sync with your OneDrive

on Unix-like operating systems (Linux, Mac Os X) and on Windows in a second time.

## Status
At the moment, we are working on wrapping the new OneDrive API with Go. The next step will be to write the CLI tool and finally the synchronisation client.
